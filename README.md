# Golobe Travel Angency Website

![Home Screen Golobe Travel Agency](/preview.png)

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for Golobe Travel Service’s website, your go-to platform for exploring and booking your next travel adventure. This intuitive web interface allows users to effortlessly search for flights and accommodations.

A full-stack nextjs project to practice and showcase the work. UI design was taken from [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1182308758714734501/golobe-travel-agency-website).

Here is the live preview of this website [golob-travel-agency.vercel.app](https://golob-travel-agency.vercel.app)

## Note:

- This website is not a real travel agency website. This was only for practicing web development. Every data shown here is not real data. This website used [fakerjs](https://fakerjs.dev/) to generate fake data.
- **Never provide your real card data here**. This website can collect information from some places (e.g: subscription, signup, payment method adding, profile photo and cover photo uploading etc.). So it is recommended not to provide your real information there. This website does not verify email during sign up. So you can signup using fake email. But if you sign in with google, facebook, or apple, it can collect your real information. So do it with caution. Use fake data instead. This data will only be saved in database and will do nothing with it. You can still test buying tickets for flight and book flight functionalities with fake data.
